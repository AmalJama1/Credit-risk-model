# Credit-risk-model
This is my very first project as data science student
# Project Highlights
I explored the five starfish of machine learninng
**Exploratory Data Analysis**- using visualizations to understand income, age, and risk profiles.
**Data Preprocessing** including missing value handling, encoding categorical features, and scaling.
**Model Building** with Logistic Regression, SVM, k-NN, and Decision Trees.
**Evaluation Metrics** such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score for model comparison.
**Feature Selection** using Random Forest Importance ranking.

## Dataset

The dataset contains customer-level information with the target variable `Is high risk` indicating loan risk status. Key features include:

- Gender, Income, Age, Marital Status
- Education level, Employment details
- Asset ownership (Car/Property), Phone/Email access
- Account age and Family member count

 ## Files used: `train_data.csv` and `test_data.csv` from kaggle.com

 ## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas, NumPy
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn
  - Scikit-learn
